v0.2.0 (2018/12/14):
    Added client-specific doc-strings to match with current mygene.py and myvariant.py clients.
    Enhanced support for MyChem.info client (using `get_client("chem")` or `get_client("drug")`)
    Added initial support for MyDisease.info client.
    Dropped the support for Python 2.6 (might still work but we don't explicitly test it under
        Python 2.6 any more)
    Support for Python 3.7
    When returned objects as a Pandas Dataframe (i.e. using "as_dataframe=True"),
        duplicated and missing hits are now returned as dataframes as well (Thanks @sdhutchins!)
    Many code optimizations.
